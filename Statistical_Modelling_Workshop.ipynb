        "This workshop will be more open ended from previous workshops as you will be using different models to classify sets of data. For each of the datasets below, use Logistic Regression, Decision Trees as well as any clustering algorithm to solve the given classification problem. For each of the models, report the accuracy score and create ROC curves to show how well your model did. For each dataset, report which model did the best job with classification given these validation metrics. Try to optimize your model by using an appropriate train/test split, sampling technique (seen in Module 5) and any other preprocessing technique. \n",
